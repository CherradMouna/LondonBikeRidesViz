This repository contains a Tableau visualization showcasing historical data for bike sharing in London, powered by TfL Open Data.

## Data
The dataset used for this visualization can be accessed via [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset/data).

## Data Preparation and Analysis
Data cleaning and initial analysis were performed using Python, utilizing libraries such as pandas, zipfile, and kaggle. The analysis was conducted in Google Colab.

## Data Visualization

This project was inspired by the tutorials from the [Mo Chen channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl9eZl1IOKI&t=743s) and has been adapted for inclusion in my portfolio.
